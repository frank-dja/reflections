-What happens when you initialize a repository? 
Why do you need to do it?
	When a repository is initialized, git creates a 
	hidden directory that will store the necessary files to 
	manage the version control. 

	We initialize a repository to start the version control 
	of a directory from the scratch, that is, without 
	copying/clonning data from other repository.
