-What happens when you initialize a repository? 
Why do you need to do it?
	When a repository is initialized, git creates a 
	hidden directory that will store the necessary files to 
	manage the version control. 

	We initialize a repository to start the version control 
	of a directory from the scratch, that is, without 
	copying/clonning data from other repository.

- How can you use the staging area to make sure 
you have one commit per logical change?
To do that, I can use "git diff" to compare the 
files of the last commit, stored in the staging area,
against the working directory files. Also, 
before commiting, I can compare the staging area files
against the files of the last commit through: 
"git diff --staged".
